Evolutionary Algorithm Optimization (README)

Problem Statement:

The provided code implements an evolutionary algorithm for optimization. Given a problem space, the algorithm aims to minimize a fitness function by evolving a population of candidate solutions over multiple generations. This optimization approach is suitable for various problem domains where traditional optimization methods may not be feasible due to complex, non-linear, or high-dimensional search spaces.

Code Overview:

main.py: This Python script serves as the main entry point for running the evolutionary algorithm. It contains the implementation of the algorithm's core logic, including population initialization, parent selection, crossover, mutation, survivor selection, and population renewal. Users can configure problem parameters such as problem size, population size, number of generations, crossover probability, mutation probability, renewal rate, and generations until renewal directly in this script.
Experimentation and Analysis:

Parameter Configuration: Users can adjust the parameters in the main.py script to tailor the evolutionary algorithm to specific optimization tasks. Parameters such as population size, number of generations, and genetic operators' probabilities can be modified to explore different algorithm behaviors and performance.

Result Analysis: Upon running the algorithm, it outputs the evolution of the best fitness value over generations. Additionally, the algorithm reports the best fitness value achieved and the generation at which it occurred. Users can analyze these results to evaluate the algorithm's performance and effectiveness in minimizing the fitness function.

Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the main.py script and configure the parameters according to your optimization problem requirements.
Run main.py to execute the evolutionary algorithm and observe the optimization process.
Review the generated plots and console output to analyze the algorithm's performance and convergence behavior.
